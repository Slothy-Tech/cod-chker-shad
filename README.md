## 🔍 What Is a Call of Duty Shadow Checker?

A Call of Duty Shadow Checker is a tool that lets you verify if your Activision account has been shadow banned. A shadow ban limits your matchmaking without notice, often placing you in high-ping lobbies with other suspected players. This tool helps you:

🎯 Confirm your account status in seconds  
🔐 Check safely via official channels  
🧄 Understand why you’re in laggy lobbies  
💻 Appeal bans or troubleshoot issues

## 🧠 What Are Shadow Checkers? (In-Depth Info)

### What is Shadow Ban Checking?

Shadow ban checking involves querying your Activision account status to see if it’s “Under Review” or restricted. In Call of Duty, shadow bans are temporary measures used by Activision’s RICOCHET anti-cheat to isolate suspected cheaters while their accounts are investigated.

This Shadow Checker guides you to the official Activision Ban Appeal page and explains what to look for — no guesswork needed.

### How Do Shadow Checkers Work?

The process relies on Activision’s support system:
- Log into your COD account on the Ban Appeal site  
- Check for “No Ban Detected,” “Under Review,” or “Permanently Banned”  
- Interpret results: “Under Review” often means a shadow ban  

It’s read-only — no changes to your account, just clarity on your status.

### How Are Shadow Checkers Developed?

While this page is a guide, advanced checkers could use scripts or APIs (if available) to automate checks. Our batch script example below simulates this by gathering system info that might correlate with ban triggers, though official status checks remain manual via Activision.

- **Avoid confusion**: Clear steps over random forums.

## ❓ Common Questions

**Does this tool lift shadow bans?**  
No, it only checks status. Appeals are handled via Activision.

**Works on all COD games?**  
Yes! Warzone, MW3, Black Ops 6, and more.

**Can I check ban reasons?**  
Not directly — Activision doesn’t specify, but “Under Review” suggests a shadow ban.

**Better than guessing from ping?**  
Absolutely. High ping (200ms+) hints at a ban, but this confirms it.

**Needs admin rights?**  
No, just your Activision login.

**Can I save my status?**  
Yes, screenshot or copy the results.

While this page links to Activision’s manual check, here’s a batch script to gather system info that might help identify ban-related triggers (e.g., hardware changes). Save as `ShadowCheck.bat` and run as admin:

```batch
@echo off
echo Checking System Info for COD Shadow Ban Analysis...
set "filename=ShadowCheck_%date:~10,4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%_%time:~0,2%%time:~3,2%.txt"

echo Shadow Check Info > "%filename%"
echo Date: %date% %time% >> "%filename%"
echo. >> "%filename%"

echo === System UUID === >> "%filename%"
wmic csproduct get UUID >> "%filename%"
echo. >> "%filename%"

echo === CPU ID === >> "%filename%"
wmic cpu get ProcessorId >> "%filename%"
echo. >> "%filename%"

echo === Disk Serial === >> "%filename%"
wmic diskdrive get SerialNumber >> "%filename%"
echo. >> "%filename%"

echo Check complete! Results in %filename%
echo Now visit https://support.activision.com/ban-appeal to confirm status.
